# AndroTest

This is a sample and rather minimal Android Gradle project that has been created from scratch, using only a text editor, the command-line tools provided by the Android SDK and Gradle.

For more details, read through the [dedicated post](https://P403n1x87.github.io/android/java/gradle/2017/10/14/android-dev.html) on [The Hub of Heliopolis](https://P403n1x87.github.io).
